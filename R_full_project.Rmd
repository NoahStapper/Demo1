Is there a relation between the depth and the magnitude of earthquakes?

```{r}

earthquake <-read_csv("earthquakes.csv") 
  
ggplot(data = earthquake) + 
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=magnitude, y=depth)) 
         
         
```
For low and high depth there can be high magnitude but not for medium depth (250-400)
