Is there a relation between the depth and the magnitude of earthquakes?

```{r}

earthquake <-read_csv("earthquakes.csv") 
  
ggplot(data = earthquake) + 
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=magnitude, y=depth)) 
         
         
```
For low and high depth there can be high magnitude but not for medium depth (250-400)

How often do earth quakes of different magnitudes happen?

```{r}

earthquake <-read_csv("earthquakes.csv")

number_of_quakes <- earthquake %>%
  summarize(date = n())

quake_depth_adapted <- earthquake %>%
mutate(
depth_km = depth/1000
)
  

quake_depth_adapted <- earthquake %>%
mutate(
depth_km = depth/1000,
depth_text = paste(depth, "meter", sep=" ")
)

ggplot(data = earthquake) + 
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=magnitude5, y=magnitude6)) 
         

```
